# Using native build of this project

Native build is simple to use but lacks customization of rclone configuration.

If you want to use browser instead of electron, please check [embed build](./embed.md)  
If you want to manage multiple remote servers, please check [PWA build](./pwa.md)

## Installation

Download installer from [rwa-desktop release](https://github.com/yuudi/rwa-desktop/releases/latest) and choose one that suits your platform.

Install, Done!
